Model of whole body arterial hypertension.

# Background. 

This model by Shi et al. in Sheffield (UK) simulates whole body blood flow
using a lumped paramter approach. The code was obtained from CellML.  

This work resulted in the article:

# Dependencies.

Sundials.

# Install.

None.

# Sources and data description.

## Data.  

The qualitative data are shown in the Figure. It shows that a newborn child suffered from hypertension,
potentially due to dialysis treatment. The model tested the hypothesis that dialysis may be a cause.

# Use.

The model is set up for parameter search in paramters that were thought to be relevant, e.g. peripheral
resistance (microvascular resistance). In addition, it uses the Sundials CVODES functions to provide
dynamic sensitivity of dynamical variables with respect to model paramters.
